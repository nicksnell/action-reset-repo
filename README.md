# Reset Git Branch

Reset a specific branch to another. Useful if you need a specific branch to be reset to say main at given intervals. NOTE: this action performs a _reset_ on the repository and is **destructive** - you will lose any changes made to the branch being reset. Be sure this is what you want to do before running.

## Usage

Example Workflow using a schedule.

```yaml
name: Rest Dev Branch to Main at 1am each day
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 1 * * *"
jobs:
  reset:
    name: Runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Reset dev branch to main
        uses: nicksnell/action-reset-repo@main
        with:
          reset_branch: dev
```
